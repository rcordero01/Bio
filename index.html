        <h2>Hello.</h2>

  <p class="about-me">Thanks for visiting my personal site. I've been part of Austin's tech industry since 2014.
  <br>My career began as a customer support specialist for Apple.
  <br>I then went on two work for two SaaS companies, CSO Research and Blackbaud Inc, as a client relations specialist.. </p> <button type="button" class="collapsible active">(see more)

<div class="content">
  <br>Eventually, I landed at Indeed, where I had the chance to contribute to the creation of a new product operations team.
  <br>During my time, I monitored more than one thousand integrations that leveraged Indeed's API to drive job applicants to their platforms. 
  <br>I helped troubleshoot API integrations prior to launch, and then continued to monitor those integrations. 
  <br>My knowledge of Python and SQL grew rapidly, and I soon began writing scripts to automate tasks, as well as creating Jupyter notebooks to monitor integration health. 
  <br>We also helped our engineering teams on various QA initiatives. Our team grew rapidly, and soon I was promoted to team lead.
  <br> Most recently I worked for eBaY, (on behalf of Acceleration Partners Inc) helping clients leverage eBay's robust APIs to drive sales and earn commisions.
  <br>Some of my duties included leading intro calls with clients, troubleshooting issues with API integrations, and advocating on behalf of clients to our engineering teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  I also have experience in web development. During the summer of 2021, I attended General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive. 
  <br>We learned how to build robust full-stack web applications using the MERN-stack.
